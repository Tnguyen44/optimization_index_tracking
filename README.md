# optimization_index_tracking
Group project aiming at designing optimization models to replicate the performance of a financial index (e.g., S&amp;P 500) with fewer assets (index tracking). They may also try enhanced indexation by slightly deviating from the index to improve returns, comparing error measures (tracking error vs. excess return).
